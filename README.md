# Assistant Watson-Alex

![](img/audio-arch.png)

<hr>

## Introduction

With this project, you can quickly build a Node-RED app and use the Watson cognitive services for audio conversations. You’ll use the Watson Assistant service (formerly known as Watson Conversation service) and its Car Dashboard Conversation workspace as a starting point to building your conversation app. You can create or import your own conversation workspace, but using this provided one will get you started quickly.

This app records your speech, sends it to the Watson services to process the request. It can handle requests for the weather, or you can send commands and receive responses through a conversation to turn on the lights or play music. The possibilities are endless.
